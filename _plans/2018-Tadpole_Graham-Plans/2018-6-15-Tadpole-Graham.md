### What is the Tadpole Graham?

It's a run & swim around Buttermere and Crummock Water. You could do it competitively, there is even a leader board
but we want to do it just for fun with a group of friends. 

You can find out way more about the route on the website for the much bigger [Frog Graham Round](http://www.froggrahamround.co.uk/tadpole-round-home/#tadpole)
but in summary it's:
* Just under 11km
* About 240m ascent
* It's a swim (600m), run (4.5km), swim (300m), run (5.45km)

### Accommodation

[Newlands Fell House](https://www.sallyscottages.co.uk/newlands-fell-house) sleeps 16 and is only 15 mins drive from the start. Looks lovely!

### Safety

We can't all do the swim, run as the partakers will need some support along the way. Ben's not into swimming either, so a cannoe is a good excuse to skip the swim.
Beck may just hop back in the water as soon as possible and skip as much of the run as possible.

You can't just rock up and pop your canoe in at Crummock nor Buttermere, we will need to get a [permit](http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/314600/Access-to-Lakes.pdf) from the national park.
