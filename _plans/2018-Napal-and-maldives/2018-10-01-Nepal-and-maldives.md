When we were in [Nepal back in 2007](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bennbeck/2052490114/in/album-72157601952126995/) we discovered that the climate and topography make it
an excellent place to learn to paraglide. Say no more, we are interested!

Since the Maldives are sort of on the way (*ahem!) we figured it would be wise to check them out and go snorkeling too.
