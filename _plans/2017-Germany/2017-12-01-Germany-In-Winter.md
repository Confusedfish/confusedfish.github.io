A pre-christmas chance to experience a traditional german winter market for some last minute gift shopping interspersed with the odd beerkeller.

We are flying over to Nurembourg (we were last here for a beer expo back when we had the brewery) then driving to [Rothenburg](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Rothenburg+ob+der+Tauber,+Germany/@49.3657932,10.0924694,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47988efdf06dff37:0x41eda32beb5f5c0!8m2!3d49.3801831!4d10.1867402)
(not to be confused with RothenbErg which is 2hrs away).
It's a beautiful walled market town next to the river Tauber. We should be able to while away a few days checking out the market stalls and sampling the local beers.

We are staying in the [Kloster Stuble](http://www.klosterstueble.de/en), we managed to book the Falcon's Nest which looks to be a beautiful hideaway.
