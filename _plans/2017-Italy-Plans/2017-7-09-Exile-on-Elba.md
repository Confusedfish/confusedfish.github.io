After our long stay in one place for a week it's time to move again, this time with a ferry hop over to Elba Island. Staying in [Hotel Cernia](http://www.hotelcernia.it/) in Sant' Andrea. There's plenty of stuff for us to do over here from walking through to undersea statues so we are stopping for 5 nights.

[Cala Violina ](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Cala+Violina/@42.8719699,10.764842,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x1329dae11dcd7c81:0x31f8c7469284caca!8m2!3d42.8562933!4d10.7745088) is probably a nice beach to visit on the way to / from Elba.

> The beach is only accessible by foot, bike or horse. It is a public beach with crystal clear water in the shape of a half moon of white sand with the green of the woods behind the beach. The name comes from a local legend that says the sands emit a sound when you walk upon them, like a violin melody.

[Marina di Alberese](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/58100+Marina+di+Alberese+Province+of+Grosseto,+Italy/@42.6490544,11.0187331,14z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x1329b4d037deffdb:0xaea8fd8e94119c56!8m2!3d42.6491965!4d11.0358349) looks like you could get a bit of beach to yourself. Not far from the above.
