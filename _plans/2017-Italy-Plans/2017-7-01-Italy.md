We *love* Italy! It's a beautiful country steeped in history, winding roads leading to coastal towns clinging to cliffs 
but best of all, chock-full of food of wonderful flavours.


We have visited the Amalfi Coast, Naples and Rome before and this time we wanted to see the Northern parts of Italy.
Previously we have used public transport but this time we wanted to drive ourselves, in an open top sports-car.

So we took out an MX-5 MK4 for a test drive, such a fun car. It's like a road legal go-kart. It would be a great fit for the Italian roads.

Update: we have now purchased a 2012, MK3 MX-5 with the power retractable hard top, purposefully out of season to get the best prices. We will no doubt be reluctant to part with it though.
