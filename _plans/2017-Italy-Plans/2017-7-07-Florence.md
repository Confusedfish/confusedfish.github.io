Lots to see and do in this busy city

#### Driving considerations

- Visitors cars are not permitted in the historic centre
- "Every 40 seconds, a motorist in Florence receives a traffic violation" making it one of Italy's most heavily fined cities. Refer to the driving comments [here](http://wikitravel.org/en/Florence#By_car)


#### Art & Architecture

- Lucca, Apparently you can cycle round the city walls (4km)
- San Gimignano (walled city)
- Pistoia - just north of Florence, market days on Wed and Sat or Jousting festival in the plaza on 25th July
