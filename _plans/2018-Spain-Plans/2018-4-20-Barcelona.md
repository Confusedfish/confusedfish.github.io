Barcelona is probably most famous for seemingly bonkers but beautiful architecture by Gaudi at the [Sagrada Familia](http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/photo-gallery/) or [Casa Batllo](https://www.casabatllo.es/en/gallery/officials/)
but there are seemingly limitless attractions to see and of course the city should be a [culinary delight](https://www.amsterdamfoodie.nl/2017/barcelona-food-guide/).

Barcelona will be the first city on the route and we will be too early for the sea to be up to temp (14C), in fact we will be at the tail end of the rainy season
so may have to dive into the odd bar or restaurant, oh dear. These should be short showers though then back to sunshine, not drab cloudy days.
The temp should be about 18C during the day so the shorts may not come out quite yet but it will be perfectly pleasant for checking out all the touristy sites 
and wandering the streets without suffering from the heat.
