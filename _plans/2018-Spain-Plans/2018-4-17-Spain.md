![MX5 MK3.5](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2855/34006483896_5e8a1e075a_h.jpg"){: .image .fit}

After the tour round Italy we were supposed to ditch the MX5 for something much more practical. 
We enjoyed the open top tour so much we held onto it and plan a repeat tour, this time round Spain.

Back in the days of the motorbike we were lucky enough to stop off at the [Parador in Hondarribia](http://www.parador.es/en/paradores/parador-de-hondarribia).
It turns out there are many more Paradors to explore so we plan to spend our time seeking them out.

We will be travelling late April through until the end of May. Spain is a huge country so we will be seeing a fair bit of variety in the weather.
