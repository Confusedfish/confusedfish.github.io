For holiday we thought we would go to school... to [learn to Paraglide](http://www.paraglidingspain.co.uk/).
We often see these graceful birds hovering over the local hills back home, but we were also intrigued when we watched a couple setting up to fly back down
off a mountain we had just walked up. All the way back down it was on our minds how easily they were floating back to base.

The two week course should see us trained up enough to launch from club sites back in the UK.
