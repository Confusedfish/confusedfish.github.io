Ben has relatives on the tiny Scottish island of Bereray (it's just 10 square km and has a 10th of the population of Bamford). The island is connected to South Uist by a causeway where there are ferries to the mainland. 
There is also a ferry to North Uist where there is a ferry to Skye and then another causeway to the mainland.

We have visited Skye before, it was a beautiful blend of white sandy beaches, mountains and idyic emptiness. We have every expectation this would just be amplified on the the Outer Hebrides.

A circular route is possible from [Skye](https://www.calmac.co.uk/hopscotch-14-harris-uists) for about Â£110 for a VW camper sized vehicle. You could do it in a car of course but the idea of aquiring some 
smoked fish from the smokehouse on North Uist all in the comfort of the camper on a white sandy beach watching the sun go down sounds idylic.

It's a 1,100 mile roundtrip, assuming about 100 miles on the islands.
