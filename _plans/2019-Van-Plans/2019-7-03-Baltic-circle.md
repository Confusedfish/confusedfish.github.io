About 5,000 miles to go up through Norway, Sweeden, into Finland, down through Estonia, Warsaw, Berlin and back home. Quite the trip and would need a lot of planning. It would te 20 days just to drive round the loop 
so this is more likely a 3 month excursion than just a jaunt.

Assume fuel in a car £545, VW type camper £670 and a big camper to be £1000
