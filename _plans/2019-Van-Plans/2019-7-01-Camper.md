Camping is not something you will hear either of us suggest in polite conversation, however lately we have been pondering a return to using a campervan. 

We converted an old van into our home back in 1999. We travelled across Canada, visited plenty of the USA and had a whale of a time. Why wouldn't we like it still? We both can work remotely, need very little and love to travel. It sounds ideal.

So where would we go in such a mobile house and what would we do that we wouldn't do otherwise?
