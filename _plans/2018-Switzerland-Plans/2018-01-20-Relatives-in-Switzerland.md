No plans other than a good family catch up with Andrew, Mel & Frejya and possibly a gondola up a ski hill to throw ourselves down. Last time we were here it was mid summer
so it will be interesting to see how different the Swiss Alps are mid Winter.

What follows is a quick list of a few of the hills we might visit, doubt we will make all of them though, we are only in the area for a week.
