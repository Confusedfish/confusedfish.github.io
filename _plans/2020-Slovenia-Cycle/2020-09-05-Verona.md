The last time we were in Verona there wasn't a showing on at the arena and we vowed to come back. It's not massively off route and we are planning well ahead so have managed to book decent seats for [Aida](https://www.arena.it/arena/en/shows/aida-2020.html).
 
Our research has boiled down to basically there are some rows with considerably more leg room and better views, the ones where there is a barrier in front. We have gone for row 10 and will report back. I think wherever you sit it's going to be
an amazing specticle in an ancient open air 30,000 seat arena!
