When heading to Europe we tend to avoid the French tolls and head straight over to Belgium. Bruges or Ghent are both a good stopping point for us as it's about as far as you want to go in a day from Bamford. They both offer fantastic food & beer opportunities.
From here it's a big days drive to Switzerland.
