The meat of the holiday is a cycle from Kranjska Gora down to the coast through numerous vinyards, olive groves, past [lakeside castles](https://www.bled.si/en/what-to-see-do/attractions/15/bled-castle), [disused railways](http://www.parenzana.net/en), and [emerald rivers](https://www.soca-valley.com/en/summer/other-adventures/natural-swimming-pools/2017060810485674/the-nadiza-river/) to cool off in. The 255km route would normally take 8 days but we are adding several rest days to give us a bit more time to take in the suroundings and towns along the way.

So we don't need to carry a few weeks of luggage with us each day we are being supported by [Visit Good Place](https://www.visit-goodplace.com/tours/bike-slovenia-green-bike-tour) who will drive our stuff between hotels and take care of organising everything for us.

After a few weeks on two wheels we will be given a lift back to our car back up in the mountains where we will probably pop pack to Switzerland for a bit more fondue before heading back home.
