The meat of the holiday is a cycle from Kranjska Gora down to the coast through numerous vinyards, olive groves, past [lakeside castles](https://www.bled.si/en/what-to-see-do/attractions/15/bled-castle), [disused railways](http://www.parenzana.net/en), and [emerald rivers](https://www.soca-valley.com/en/summer/other-adventures/natural-swimming-pools/2017060810485674/the-nadiza-river/) to cool off in. The 255km route would normally take 8 days but we are adding several rest days to give us a bit more time to take in the suroundings and towns along the way.

So we don't need to carry a few weeks of luggage with us each day we are being supported by [Visit Good Place](https://www.visit-goodplace.com/tours/bike-slovenia-green-bike-tour) who will drive our stuff between hotels and take care of organising everything for us.


When heading to Europe we tend to avoid the French tolls and head straight over to Belgium. Bruges or Ghent are both a good stopping point for us as it's about as far as you want to go in a day from Bamford. They both offer fantastic food & beer opportunities.
From here it's a big days drive to Switzerland. 

After a few days with Andrew, Mel & Freyja we will take a short diversion to Verona. The last time we were in Verona there wasn't a showing on at the arena and we vowed to come back. It's not massively off route and we are planning well ahead so have managed to book decent seats for [Aida](https://www.arena.it/arena/en/shows/aida-2020.html). Our research has boiled down to basically there are some rows with considerably more leg room and better views, these are the ones where there is a barrier in front. We have gone for row 10 and will report back. I think wherever you sit it's going to be an amazing specticle in an ancient open air 30,000 seat arena!

From Verona we will head to the start of the cycle up in the mountains of Slovenia. After a few weeks on two wheels we will be given a lift back to our car back up in the mountains where we will probably pop pack to Switzerland for a bit more fondue before heading back home.
