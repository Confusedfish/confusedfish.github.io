			<h1>About Us</h1>
		</header>

		<p>We are Ben &amp; Rebecca McIntyre from Bamford, Derbyshire which is a great little village in the Peak District but we sometimes like to get away for a bit. Often the 'bit' becomes quite long as we get carried away with the wanderlust for new places.</p>

		<p>Photos are recently being taken with a Canon 70D or simply on a mobile. In most cases further details about the camera lens / settings can be found on Flickr. If you have any queries about a photo feel free to leave a comment on Flickr.</p>

		<h2 id="content">What is this site for</h2>
		<p>It's for us to record our various mianderings, plan future ones and hopefully give inspiration to others.</p>

		<h2 id="content">How does the site work</h2>
		<p>The site is served by the generous hosts at <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and is coded using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which is a great platform for managing a site like this without the need for a CMS. Our photos are hosted on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bennbeck">Flickr</a> and video content is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU7oNbVPDfufDrcAZX0pD7g">YouTube</a>.</p>
