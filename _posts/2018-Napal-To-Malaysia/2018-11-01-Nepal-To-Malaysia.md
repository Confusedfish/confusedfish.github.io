We have visited Nepal in the past, it's a stunning country with lovely people. 
When we were in Pokrah last, between eating momos, we learned that the landscape & climate lends itself to learning to paraglide and we have wanted to return since.

From Nepal we would thne like to overland down through Thailand into Malaysia, popping out in Singapore for our return flight to the UK.
