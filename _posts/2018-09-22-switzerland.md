After the searing heat of Spain it’s a bit of a relief to be in the relative cool of Switzerland. The days are bright and skies are blue; pleasantly warm rather than baking hot. 
We are visiting Andrew, Mel and Freyja, who relocated here about six weeks ago from Cham, further to the west of Switzerland. They’ve chosen a brilliant place to live, right on the shores of the Walensee 
and we head down there most evenings. The water is cool, but still warm enough to dip. Behind the lake is an allotment where people are out gardening most evenings. To one side, a welcoming campsite, 
still full of people enjoying the last days of the season. BBQ pits stud the shoreline just waiting to be used. The opportunity for activity is endless. Walking, cycling, wine tasting, tennis, volleyball, swimming,
sailing, windsurfing, paddle boarding, skiing, snowboarding, paragliding are all on the doorstep. But for now, we are content to sit, warm in the sun, and enjoy the stunning blues and greens of the scenery.

Our days are more active. We take on the challenge of the walk up to the Murgseehutte, a six hour hike up to the snow line. We encounter very few people on the whole route and vow to come back again, planning next
time to coordinate it so we can take lunch at the cute little hut.

Another morning we attempt a mile canoe trip across to the lake to Quinten, a pedestrianised village, and back. This should be no problem and easily doable in the three hour window we have while Freyja is at school.
But we had reckoned without the determination of Boaty Mcboatface to send us in 360 degree pirouettes. Forty five minutes of battling with the canoe ensue. We reach the shores of Quinten and head for schoggi in the
lake side restaurant. They eye us suspiciously and I suppose we do look a bit of a sight, sopping wet through from our endeavours.  On the return trip one side of the canoe decides to rebel further and deflate, threatening
to dump us in the lake. We spend the rest of the journey leaning into the inflated side to compensate and breathe a huge sigh of relief when we reach the shores of Murg.

Towards the end of our week we venture out on bikes, taking in half the lake from Murg to Betlis. The route takes us through tunnels, up hills to the tallest waterfall in Switzerland (Seerenbachfälle).
Given the dry summer the waterfall is making a good effort by appearing at all, in spring it would be amazing. We return via the ferry to save our legs although this proves to be an expensive experience as
bikes are charged nearly the same as a human. They take up more room so we kind of understand but didn't expect it!

Having learned to fly the paraglider in Spain Ben also tries his hand at flying in the Swiss Alps. A local flying school is enlisted as guide:

Everything is different to Spain (and the UK): the last two flights in Spain were very thermic, lots of turbulence and a quick elevator ride right up to the clouds. By contrast, 
in Switzerland the arid fields of Spain are replaced with big snow capped mountains and the access is no longer simple. It's two bus rides, a walk to the cable car followed by a 50 minute hike to the top of the 
launch at the top of the mountain. The scenery is spectacular and launching from the snowline is yet another difference. Launching off Algodonales in the snow must be highly unusual!

The wind in Spain changed direction every few minutes but in Switzerland we are flying in valleys, the wind goes one way or the other and is consistent. Thermals are simply a type of underwear here and the flight is a silky smooth glide,
not the roller coasters of last week which feels like a bit of a disappointment but the flight becomes more of a pleasure flight, just sit back, relax and enjoy the view. One other feature of flying in Switzerland are the power lines
and cable cars. The cables seem to be everywhere but as I was assured by the flying school, they aren't much of a problem, just another hazard to be aware of. I think I would head back to Spain in preference but given the opportunity
would hardly turn down another chance in Switzerland.

On our last day in Switzerland Beck takes on the challenge of swimming the mile distance from one side of the Walensee to the other, ably supported by Ben in Boaty Mcsinkface. It’s a good day for swimming; low wind, warming sunshine
and cold, clear water. Sighting is a bit of a challenge as the sun is directly in her eyes and a new pair of tinted goggles go down on the Christmas list. The sun is very welcome, however, when she gets out and struggles with basic
conversation – an indication of just how cold the water was. Thankfully Andy has a plate of BBQ chicken and a pot of cheese fondue (essential post exercise foods) ready on the banks of the lake, along with a sun warmed glass of prosecco
in a plastic picnic mug. It’s the perfect end to the holiday. Of course, Ben took plenty of video and so Beck gets to critique her stroke and use the Divine Comedy track Neptune's Daughter as the backing music. Everyone is happy!
Later we realise that on the same weekend the previous year she had swum the Hurly Burly; a 10km estuary swim in Wales. The two swims could not have been more different, yet both were life affirming and invigorating. Watch this space
for this time next year’s swimming adventure! 

All in all, Andy and Mel have picked an amazing place to live. The scenery is stunning with fabulous weather. The trees are just starting to turn brown which contrasts well with the bright blue sky and water. We are already planning our
return in March next year to sample the local ski hill of Flumseberg.
