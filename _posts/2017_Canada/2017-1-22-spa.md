Most things in Whistler are *Extreme!* The skiing, weather, portions, etc.
The [Scandinave Spa](http://www.scandinave.com/en/whistler/) is no exception as they offer *Extreme Relaxation*.

The ticket price may seem a little high but the experience is well worth it.
before you even arrive there are polite messages that to promote relaxation that talking isn't permitted.
It's not an oppressive silence, it's tranquil, emphasising the sound of cascading water. No phones or cameras are allowed
which also helps to remove yourself from the modern obsession of remaining connected at all times.

There are numerous hot pools with waterfalls outside in the snowy elements, eucalyptus steam rooms, wood fired saunas with the aroma of freshly cut cedar.
Plunge pools with frigid (well 13C from 40C seems frigid) to bring your temperature back down before resting in the relaxation
rooms that have the most comfy chairs I have ever sat in, lulled to sleep by the background music... *repeat*

If like us you didn't have a vehicle, getting there is probably best done by taxi as it's a bit of a walk from the bus stop.
There were 4 of us so the $10 fare from the village would have been the same as the bus fare anyway.

There is a reasonable cafe on site offering a limited menu plus a good selection of cakes and hot drinks.
The free platter of fruit being offered round (in silence) was a nice touch.

All in all, this is a very well presented, zero stress place to come and spend several hours.
You will come away feeling exhaustedly relaxed, highly recommended.
