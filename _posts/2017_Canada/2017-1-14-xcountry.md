After a short week of downhill our feet are fairly stressed from being squeezed into boots,
cross country gear feel like putting slippers on and the skis are super light.
The very low temperatures help here as the snow is right down in the valley and the trail snow
holds the shape of the grooves well.

Our skis don't have wax or rails, they are simply planks with ridges to assist with going in one
direction. The boots hinge at the front where they bind with the ski and the process is much like
walking, just more fun but with the potential to end up in a heap if you get too distracted by
the beautiful scenery.

Once we get to the ticket office [at the Passivhaus](http://www.crosscountryconnection.ca/lost-lake/passivhaus/)
we opt for the pack of 10 passes, saving us a fair wedge of cash. We are fairly sure we will be making
more use of the trails since we have our own gear and are staying right next to the trail.
