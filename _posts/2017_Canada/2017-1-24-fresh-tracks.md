"Fresh tracks" is a special ticket that gets you up the gondola before everyone else. The idea being that you get to make tracks in the freshest of snow.

In addition to getting you up the mountain that bit earlier the ticket entitles you to an all you can eat breakfast. The size of the breakfast has the
unfortunate side effect of making snowboarding tricky for the rest of the day as you can't even bend over to do your bindings up!

The views are however stunning. Since we are still in January the sun hasn't even made an appearance by the time we get to the top of the gondola and we
are treated to a cloudless, early morning alpenglow show. Going from shade to highlighting the mountains in full glory in mere moments.

Since we haven't had much snow this week the emphasis was on the breakfast. The unfortunate downside of an early start being that the slope hasn't had time
to loosen up in the sun. It proves to be yet another awesome day on the mountain though once the sun hits the ridge runs.
