Rather than use yesterday's timeshare profits on sensible things like ski hire or general supplies we thought it would be better to splurge it on some fine dining!

[Christine's](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/the-village/dining/christines-restaurant) is a restaurant on Blackcomb mountain housed in the Rendezvous building.
It makes the most of the fantastic scenery but also has superb service and top notch food.

So our 3 hours of avoiding buying a timeshare was converted into:

- A bottle of Gewurztraminer
- Crispy belly pork with slow cooked egg, cauliflower puree, pickled apricot, vadouvan lentil & wild rice
- Scallops and squid, crunchy vegetables, fish sauce vinaigrette, crispy cashew, lime & black pepper
- Confit Lamb Shoulder, rosemary tomato, coco bean, white anchovy, mustard crumb
- Braised Beef Cheek, red wine sauce, charred broccoli, chestnut macaroni, parsnip & crispy amoretti
- Black Forest Gateau, tahitian vanilla, tonka bean, kirsh cherry, milk chocolate ganache
- 3 Cheese Board
- Coffees

Admittedly we did have to sub an extra &pound;50 but the timeshare funds covered most of it.

The food & decor was stunning, the service was impeccable, the clientele an interesting mix of snowboarder bums through to poshly dressed couples.

If you aren't skiing then it's an easy ride up the gondola and then over the peak 2 peak but you will need a lift ticket.

Highly recommended if you are in Whistler!
