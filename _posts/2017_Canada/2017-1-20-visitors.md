It's great fun here in Whistler, but it's even better with family and friends. Beth & Bobby have come over for a spot of sofa-surfing (well, it is a sofa bed after all).
We have given them  a fun packed schedule:

- Walking the Valley Trail to Creekside taking in the beautiful scenery
- A day of relaxation at the [Scandinave Spa](http://www.scandinave.com/en/whistler/)
- 3 days of skiing lessons to get them down the slopes
- Fresh Tracks breakfast to get them up the slopes before the crowds
- Evening [Snowmobiling tour](https://www.canadianwilderness.com/fondue/) of the mountain
- [Dog sledding](https://www.canadianwilderness.com/dogsled/) in the Callaghan Valley
- Possibly a [skeleton run](http://www.whistlersportlegacies.com/activities/skeleton) down the luge if the lure of another day's skiing isn't too strong and they are nuts enough
- Vancouver for a few days
- Beer if they can stay awake long enough after their day on the mountain
