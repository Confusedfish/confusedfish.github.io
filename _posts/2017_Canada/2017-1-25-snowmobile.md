After a full days skiing lesson we thought it would be a good idea to cram in another activity into Beth & Bobby's schedule.
Snowmobiling is a motorised activity so they should be fine... turns out it takes a fair degree of strength to keep the sled straight
and given it's now dark it's also much colder than the day.

We went with [Canadian Wilderness](https://www.canadianwilderness.com/fondue/) on the 4.30pm excursion. You would undoubtedly get more
for your money if you bought a sled outright on the second hand market ($1,500 CAD on ebay) but given one of our group stacked it into 
a ditch requiring a 20 minute delay while we helped dig out the sled, it's probably good that we are getting lessons instead!

The sunset looking back over the Callaghan valley was impressive until I realised it was only orange because of the goggles, still very beautiful. The headlights
were nice and strong which was handy given it was pitch black in moments.

The outing began with the basics of leaning the sled while making turns and to compensate for slopes & emergency stops. 
Some sleds had drivers taking it in turns, so we did this procedure twice. Shortly after the stacking it into a ditch episode,
we practiced steep descents (at the top of Excalibur gondola).

Once we were all trained up, and upright, we dodged snowcats (not felines but big machines that spend the night grooming the slopes) and made our way up to
Crystal hut for some welcome warming soup. The views on the way were impressive even though it was dark, looking down onto the lights of Whistler. Whenever we
cut across the newly groomed slopes we couldn't help but feel sorry for destroying the snowcat drivers hard work.

At the end of the tour we diverted up some more challenging side tracks. These machines can handle some seriously steep terrain and have plenty of beans
if you want to floor it. The problems just come when you want to change direction but surely practice would make that easier.

In summary, it was a good outing that we all enjoyed. The group size was possibly a bit bigger than we would have wanted causing a few delays every now and then
to allow the group to bunch back up and check everyone was alright. The equipment was high quality and all winter warm gear was provided although we didn't need them
as we just wore our ski gear. The training although minimal was clear and by the end of the outing we had covered a fair bit of ground and were quite confident on the
sled.

Would we do it again? Given us, it's more likely we would buy an electric model, truck to move it round and hit the backcountry!

To celebrate not being eaten by a snowcat we ended the night in the [Brickworks pub](http://thebrickworks.ca/) for several pitchers of honey lager. The menu was enticing enough for us to
plan a return visit for supper.
