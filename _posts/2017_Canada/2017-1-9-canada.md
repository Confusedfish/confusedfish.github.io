Canada was probably the launchpad for our wonderlust, a country of seemingly boundless outdoors.

It was our first choice destination after graduating from Sheffield University back in 1999 and what a great choice!
In summary we somehow had the fortune of ending up in Whistler, British Columbia watching the snow gradually increase in thickness until the ski hill opened.
We found good jobs considering we were itinerant at the time and hit the slopes whenever we weren't working. 

We saw the millenium in, cold sober as Beck had been working up until midnight, the town was a riot, the millenium bug failed to materialise.
May 2000 arrived and there was still plenty of snow to be had but we hit the road, down to San Fransico, through Bryce, Arches, back up through B.C. to the border with Alaska, then struck east to Quibec & Montreal, then down into New Hampshire before calling it a day and heading home.

**17 years later** and we are back to see what has changed...
