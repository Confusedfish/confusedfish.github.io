Whistler is a great place to spend money - you can do pretty much any activity under the sun, but pretty much always at a cost. Even tobogganing is monetised via the Tubing park with big signs at the bottom of the hill prohibiting you from just hiking up with a sledge. So when an activity is offered for free it’s a bit of a surprise. The regular [Fire and Ice show](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/events-and-activities/activities/fire-and-ice-show) at the base of Whistler gondola is therefore a welcome change in that it is totally free of charge and well worth a visit. So much so, that we did it twice in one week! The second time we decided to make an evening of it and book slopeside seats at the [Garibaldi Lift Company](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/the-village/dining/glc) (GLC), a bar and restaurant, combining the show with dinner. Initially we thought that the cost for reserving a spot was $3 (see, that old thing about monetising everything gets you eventually!). It turned out that it was $3 PER PERSON. Had it just been the two of us we would probably have given up at this point, but we had visitors and wanted them to have a good night out, so we paid our money. As it turned out, it was well worth the fee. We got seats outside right next to the action, surrounded by patio heaters and kept cosy with blankets. The food we ordered was unanimously declared delicious. Better still we got great views of the Fire and Ice show – skiers and boarders flying through the air passing through hoops of fire, some with fireworks strapped to their ankles is quite the sight! The evening rounds off with a nice firework display. Highly recommended.
