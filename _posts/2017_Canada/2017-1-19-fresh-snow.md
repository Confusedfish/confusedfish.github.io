After a while the slope can get a bit hard to take a fall on. The obvious answer being not to take a fall, but thats not always an option.

Fortunately mother nature has decided to top us up a bit (by a bit, think 1m over a week). Last week the temperatures were a frigid -20C
but now they are a hovering about 0C. There's been a frustrating amount of fog and rain lower down in the valley but thats a price well worth paying
because at the top in the alpine things are amazing.

Where before moguls (big lumps of snow formed by dastardly skiers) were icy hard and to be avoided, they are now fluffy pillows waiting to explode as you
make a turn on top of them. We see it as the snowboarder's job to eradicate the signs of the skiers wherever possible and this is suddenly a great game
of pillow fight.

A few days of snow and low visibility and the mountain is topped up again, time to turn the blue skies back on. The trees are laden with snow, the slopes are full
of people whooping with joy. We certainly can't contain ourselves and are in fits of laughter all the way down.
