Skiing boots can be devices of torture, the foot being locked into an inflexible hard shell with various bolts and leavers.
Snowboard boots by comparison are far more flexible, have laces and although they look more like they belong on the moon they are things of comfort... unless they are 17 years old!

After a week of trying to ignore the pain it was time to bite the bullet and consign Beck's originals to the bin.

The guys at [Showcase](http://www.showcasesnowboards.com/) (we went through 4 advisors) were fantastic with lots of choice, and even better, we get 20% discount with our season passes.
