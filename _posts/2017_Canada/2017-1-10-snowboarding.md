Whistler Blackcomb is the full name of the resort and is actually 2 mountains with some
really big stats like a mile vertical from top to bottom and 8171 acres of terrain.
Lots more can be [found online](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/discover/why-whistler) so there
is no point in us repeating things here.

Our main reason for coming back wasn't for all those stats, although they help of course.
It's the welcoming spirit of Canadians, they couldn't be more friendly.
Lift lines are minimal, but then when they do exist it's a polite merging like a zip,
not the need for shoulder pads that is the norm in Europe.

We picked a perfect year, there have been a few duff years recently but seemingly since we
booked things back in September the snow has been building.
By the time we landed there had been over 5m of snowfall.
Unseasonably low temperatures (-20C) have held this snow in place and the skies are open bright blue,
with very little in the way of cloud.
If it wasn't so cold we would have got a tan in the first week but we have been well wrapped up. 

The bright light is helpful to pick out the lie of the land as the snow is now reasonably hard packed,
not the soft and fluffy delight of powder, but we are here for 6 weeks and there is plenty of time for
mother nature to come up with the goods.
