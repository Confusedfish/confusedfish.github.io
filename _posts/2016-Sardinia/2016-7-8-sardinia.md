Due to an unfortunate incident with the [Canon EOS App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.canon.ic.eos.eosremote&hl=en) the photos from Sardinia have been degraded in quality.

Although Sardinia is part of Italy it is also strongly independant, so not just yet more Italy but Italy with an extra helping of [bottarga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottarga).
Sat out in the middle of the Med it is surrounded by azure waters and beautiful white sandy beaches, blessed with great weather.
