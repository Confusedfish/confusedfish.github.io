Cinque Terra region is a national park with several villages connected by a train running through the steep hillside. There is a footpath connecting the villages with stunning views of the sea.

We will have had a run of luxuary up in Tuscany and on Elba. The Cinque Terra is set to be far more rustic but we are looking forward to this just as much. Our [accommodation](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/6810407) is perched on the edge of a cliff far away from basically everything. It's going to be awesome!
