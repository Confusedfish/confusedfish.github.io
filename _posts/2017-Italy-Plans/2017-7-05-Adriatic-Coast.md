From Venice we strike South through the bustle of Ravenna & Rimini to Portonovo just south of Ancona. The [Hotel Emilia](http://www.hotelemilia.com/it/) looks amazing, as does the coastline.

#### Ravenna

- [Famous mosaics](http://www.ravennamosaici.it/?lang=en)
- [Wikitravel](http://wikitravel.org/en/Ravenna)

#### Rimini

- *Resort town* with long sandy beach (avoid in August, this will be a very busy location)
- Tiberius Bridge (only ~2000 years old)
- [Wikitravel](http://wikitravel.org/en/Rimini)

#### Conero Riviera

As an alternative to busy Rimini consider going a bit further south into the [Conero Riviera](http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/the-marches/poi/the-conero-riviera.html) as a less populated if still popular alternative with beaches only accessable by path / boat.

It would be possible to overnight here and then visit Assisi on the way up into Tuscany
