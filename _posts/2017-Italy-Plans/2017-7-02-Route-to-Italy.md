Having taken the Eurotunnel in the past using the motorbike, it was a super slick experience, hopefully this will be just the same. We will be in London for meetings and it makes no sense to head home then back south so we will be heading away straight after work. It's only a couple of hours to the tunnel...

We have wanted to check out Brugge for a while now and although this will only allow for a couple of nights it should give us an idea of the place and if we want to come back for a more in depth visit. We will be getting in late and heading off early on the second day so really only one day in Brugge.

B&B Accommodation: [Villa di raisins](http://www.villadesraisins.be/index.asp?taal=en) not too far from the historic centre.

From Brugge the plan is to avoid the tolls of France by driving through Belgium, into Luxembourg, back into France into Switzerland. By now we will be in need of rest and the [Pepper & Salt](http://www.pfefferundsalz-gengenbach.de/index.php) hotel in the Black Forest looks a great midway stop.

After the overnight stop, it's on through the mountaints of Switzerland into Italy to the shores of [Lago Maggiore](http://www.illagomaggiore.com/en_US/26091,Poi.html)

We will be staying at our first AirBnB on this trip, in [Arona](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/13905960) just for a couple of nights to recover from the couple of days of long driving.
