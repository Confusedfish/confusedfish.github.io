Having taken the Eurotunnel in the past using the motorbike, it was a super slick experience, hopefully this will be just the same.

We have wanted to check out Brugge for a while now and although this will only allow for an overnight stop it should give us an idea of the place and if we want to come back for a more in depth visit.

From Brugge the plan is to avoid the tolls of France by driving through Belgium, into Luxembourg, back into France into Switzerland. By now we will be in need of rest and the town of Lucerne looks interesting with its medieval bridge.

After the overnight stop, it's on through the mountaints into Italy...

#### Alternatives

- Enter Italy through the Mont Blanc tunnel then through [Aosta valley](http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/aosta-valley.html) with it's many castles and walled city
