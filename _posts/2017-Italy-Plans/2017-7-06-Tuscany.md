It's a short hop from Ancona up into Tuscany where we will be staying in place for 8 nights. On the way up we will check out Assisi. Ben's parents will be joining us for the extended stay
so we are staying in this bigger & lovely looking [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/5667701) which should be fairly central for visiting all the sights in the region.
