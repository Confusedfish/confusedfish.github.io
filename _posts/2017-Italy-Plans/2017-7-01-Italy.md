We *love* Italy! It's a beautiful country steeped in history, winding roads leading to coastal towns clinging to cliffs 
but best of all, chock-full of food of wonderful flavors.

<p>We have visited the Amalfi Coast, Naples and Rome before and this time we wanted to see the Northern parts of Italy.
Previously we have used public transport but this time we wanted to drive ourselves, in an open top sports-car.</p>

<p>So we took out an MX-5 for a test drive, such a fun car. It's like a road legal go-kart. It would be a great fit for the Italian roads. This is a MK4 which is out of our price range, so it's hopefully going to be a MK3 with all the trimmings.</p>
