Lots of options available for the return journey but we can probably get away with not booking accommodation until later.

We would have liked to have headed back over to revisit both Carcassone & Hondaribia before getting the ferry back from Santander. We have never been to [Versailles](http://en.chateauversailles.fr/) though so we will probably route up through the Alps to Paris, check out Versailles and then take the ferry over to Plymouth and catch a quick visit to family in Cornwall.
