We may have only travelled to a time zone one hour different to our own, but in adapting to the Spanish way of life, we might as well have travelled all the way to Australia. 
We are here for 6 weeks â€“ and boy are we gonna need it to rearrange our body clocks to cope with 9pm dinners. Back home we would be eating at 5pm so this is a bit of a shock to the system! 

In our new world order a typical day may go something like this: 

* Get up at 8am for a run before the day gets hot
* Back to base for breakfast of coffee and pastries
* Head out for some sightseeing around 10am until lunchtime calls around 1.30pm
* Eat a large lunch which generally wipes us out
* Head back to base around 4pm for a siesta till 6pm
* A few more hours sightseeing in the cool of the early evening, followed by...
* Tapas and beers at 9-ish
* Crash into bed around midnight
* Rinse and repeat
