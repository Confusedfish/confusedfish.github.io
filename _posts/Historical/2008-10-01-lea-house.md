description: Time to break free of Sheffield and move out into the Peak District. Buying a house at auction was interesting but we bought on the cusp of a recession making things even more fun

We took the building back to bare bricks, roof off, floors up, re-plumbed, wired, windowed. It was a long hard year of labour doing as much of the work ourselves as we could.
It's a lovely home and we are super happy to live where we do.
