It all seemed like a good idea at the time...

Combine the start of our trip with a pre-arranged meeting in London, so that we don’t have to travel to London 
and back and then to Folkestone the following day. However, sitting in central London traffic it was starting 
to feel like a bad call. We set the GPS to avoid the congestion zone which may have accounted for some of the extra time but the first part 
of our journey really did confirm our previous opinion to NEVER DRIVE IN LONDON!!! 

While Beck had her meeting, Ben met up with Alex to check out his [swanky offices](http://mettle-studio.com/about/) and get introduced to a fabulous deli: [Kastner & Ovens](https://www.coventgarden.london/cafes/kastner-ovens) 

However, by 4pm we were on the road out of the City, headed to Folkestone and the [Chunnel](https://www.eurotunnel.com), 
and on target to make an earlier crossing than planned. Hot weather, open top on the car, quick hop over to Calais 
and we are on the continent! The Chunnel really is an easy way to travel. Forget two hour check-ins, queues at passport 
control, having to take off shoes, having to pay extra for checked baggage, not being able to take liquids and having 
to wait to collect bags at the other end – you just rock up twenty mins before departure, show your passport, drive onto the train and away you go.
