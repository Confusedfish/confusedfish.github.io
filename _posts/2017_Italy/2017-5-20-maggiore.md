The rain of Gengenbach is firmly behind us. After a lunchtime stop over visiting Mel in [Switzerland](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bennbeck/albums/72157681875878501)
it's only a short drive through beautiful fjord-like scenery, through the epic [Gotthard tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_Road_Tunnel) and around Lago Maggiore into Italy.

First things first, it's a walk up to the Statua di [San Carlo Borromeo](http://www.statuasancarlo.it/the-statue/) to peer out of a man's nostril! This is reputed to be
the colossus statue that inspired the architect of the Statue of Liberty. The climb up inside the sculpture is a little hair-raising to say the least, the views from the
balcony surpass the ones from his ear or nostril but if you have a head for heights and want a little challenge then head up to the head for a look out.

Having scaled the colossus we wander back into town to sample the many food establishments such as Nautica with it's superb view of the lake and are introduced to 
apperitevos (sort of drinks + Italian style tapas) at the highly recommended Cafe De La Sera.

Not having driven enough by now we want to get the top down and see some of the country. This sees us stumbling across the charming Orta San Giulio, over on [Lago d'Orta](http://www.guidaturisticalagomaggiore.com/cusio__lago_d_orta.html).
This place is stunning and was totally unexpected. We only spend an hour here but could certainly see ourselves coming back, staying in a 
hotel with a balcony overlooking the central piazza.
