A quick stop over in the Black Forest for some Gateaux staying in the [Pfeffer & Salz](http://www.pfefferundsalz-gengenbach.de) hotel which is a
little walk out of the town but set in beautiful wine country.

We only saw a little of the beautiful wine country due to a full day of very heavy rain, but what we did see
made us want to come back at a more appropriate time of year or with more appropriate atire. If not just to sample more of the delicious
rosti at the [Schatull](http://www.schatull.de), still not sure what a Shatull is other than a great bar in Gengenbach.
