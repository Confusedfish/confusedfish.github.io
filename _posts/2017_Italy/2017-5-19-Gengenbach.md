A quick stop over in the Black Forest for some Gateaux staying in the [Pfeffer & Salz](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfefferundsalz-gengenbach.de%2F&source=maps&cd=1&usg=AFQjCNHnOy3AhqYr-px0HQul0jX8eX4UFQ&sig2=Ye_J7pCBI6WtfpJfYNeRSw&ved=1i%3A1%2Ct%3A3443%2Ce%3A0%2Cp%3ARYQiWdznIoL7UMWdhqgF%3A1075) hotel which is a
little walk out of the town but set in beautiful wine country.

We only saw a little of the beautiful wine country due to a full day of very heavy rain, but what we did see
made us want to come back at a more appropriate time of year or with more appropriate atire.
