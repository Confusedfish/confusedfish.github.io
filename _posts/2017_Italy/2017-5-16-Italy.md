Exactly 3 months to the day since our return from [Canada]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017_Canada/2017-1-9-canada.md %})
and having enjoyed the [Amalfi Coast & Rome](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bennbeck/albums/72157627061930350) back in 2011 we thought we were due a road trip round Italy. To get us there we are
riding in a Mazda MX-5 which has the transformatitve power of [Optimus Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime),
well, the top goes down when the sun comes out.
