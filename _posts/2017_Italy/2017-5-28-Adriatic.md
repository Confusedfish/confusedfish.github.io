If anywhere on this trip merits dressing for dinner, the [Hotel Emilia](http://www.hotelemilia.com/en/) in Portonovo is the place. 
I must admit that this stop had passed me a little, as Ben had found and booked this place and actually I’m quite glad that it did.
It made the impact all the greater on arrival! 

This is a place that was made for the practice of [La Bella Figura](http://www.eyeitalia.com/la-bella-figura-italy/) – literally cutting a dashing figure!
And so we posh up and head down for dinner. The starter is a choux bun filled with whipped ricotta and drizzled with basil oil.
It’s light as a feather and gone in a moment – but what a delicious moment! The rest of the meal follows in a similar vein. 

We spent our time here swapping pool for azure sea and back again; heating up on the land, only to cool right off in the water.
It’s blissful. Also worth a mention is the little beach hut on the Spiaggia Mezzavalle. We weren’t expecting much given the vertiginous path down from the road,
but the beach bar had all we needed; coffee slushy, focaccia for €1.50 and plenty of shade. 

Another fantastic food stop was [Il Molo](http://ilmolo.it) right on the beach for a bounty of seafood. 
The waiter's expression was one of 'you have way over ordered' and he was proven right as even Ben couldn't finish it all.

A word of warning to the uninitiated to staying in an Italian room facing the Adriatic, if you have blinds, use them! We were woken at 5am to a blinding sunrise,
beautiful but seriously, unless you are on a fishing boat there is no need to be awake at this hour!
